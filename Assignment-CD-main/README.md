Creating a server at Digital Ocean 

When I have my own vpn from Digital Ocean, it was so nice and exiting moment because I felt that I started to become a real programmer in Web-world. Step by step by following this course, I could make my Flask app. That was also challenging, All the time I had to struggle with no connection error. And I had to use Gunicorn main:app --bind 0.0.0.0 intead of Gunicorn main:app. During this assignment, I noted a lot of commands and troublesomes on my notebook whenever I encountered them or learned them by seeking a solution. In order to make application, I needed to make a code at Flask, after that I used Gunicorn. Then I was working with my own vpn server with Nginx to connect with Gunicorn. When there is Website, I need to have all of the components (such as Nginx, Gunicorn and Flask) in order to make app efficiently and securely. 

There were lots of troublesome that I encountered, hereby there are sone of the most difficult errors to complete this assignment. 

Problem 1: Go to an appropriate directory
At the beginning, I had to figure out which one between my server and a local server should I use in order to control and commit website. And if I want to use Gunicorn, I firstly have to use my vpn, then I could make a farm-site. 

Problem 2: When I have an error with Flask with my server, I had to use main:app –bind 0.0.0.0 instead of main:app. And I had a difficult time with scp function in order to copy some data from my local to my server. It was important to find a right folder and right directory. 

Problem 3: File “Run-tests” did not run with an error: Process completed with exit code 127.
At first, I had to make a txt file with requirements, then it should be updated with 7.2.0. instead of 6.1.2. The version of requirements was not updated. Finally, I could manage this issue with study coach.

Problem 4: Trouble with making right secrets
When I tried to connect with GitHub with a local server to clone and add files to repository at GitHub, there was an issue with “GitHub permit denied”. There are a lot of solutions with this error, the link https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys/ was helpful. 

Problem 5: Deploy “error: can’t connect without a private SSH key or password.”
I used the link https://coderflex.com/blog/2-easy-steps-to-automate-a-deployment-in-a-vps-with-github-actions in order to connect with my server and GitHub. But the configuration was outdated, and I got an error with the statement above. I could solve this issue with a link https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/issues/108. 

Finally, I solved problems, not totally, but I have learned a lot about Linux with git Bash shell, and Github was new to me at the beginning of this course, but now I know much more about it, that was a great learning point for me.
